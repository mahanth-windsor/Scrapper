Solid commercial experience (5+ years) designing, building and operating scalable, distributed systems as part of a product engineering team
Being responsible for the complete design/develop/test/build/release/maintain web application lifecycle, as well as associated infrastructure and tools - preferably in a Python context
Network design choices covering CDNs, load balancing, VPCs, reverse proxies and DNS
Database and cache design and implementation covering synchronous and asynchronous writes and schema versioning
Data and infrastructure security
Serverless architectures
Peer reviewing code to ensure it meets both functional and non-functional requirements and standards
Building out and supporting CI/CD pipelines that ensure test objectives are automatically delivered and version controlled
A strong understanding and hands on experience of test strategy, scope, efforts, automation and end to end regression testing
Use of development collaboration tools such as Jira, Bitbucket/Git and Confluence
Communicating with technical and non-technical peers

What we can offer you: 

A fun, easy-going environment
Project days to encourage lifelong learning
A high degree of autonomy and the ability to influence team and technology choices
Opportunity to grow with the company
Share options

Working hours and location: 
This is a full-time (40hr), permanent, remote position, but the hours will be up to you. As long as you have a 5-6hr overlap with the core team each day, you can choose when you are online. Please note that due to this requirement, we prefer candidates living ±3hrs from the EST time zone. You must reside in and have the legal right to work within Canada.

Enable Education is a leader in company culture. We’re also on the cutting edge of instructional technology. For the last 15 years, we’ve been producing innovative, custom education platforms that the competition can’t match.
Now we’re expanding our product offerings. We’ve created a brand-new spin-off company, Sidekick Training, which has launched an education technology platform. Imagine if Zoom was built for live corporate training. Guided by learner data insights, this product choreographs engaging, live-learning experiences for measurable training effectiveness.
Sidekick is on the cusp of something truly special. With the broad shift to remote learning across all industries, and limited software options available, there is enormous opportunity for a live, virtual training platform like Sidekick to take off. That’s where you come in.
We are looking for an experienced Back-end Developer to join our team.
What you’ll be doing: 
At Sidekick we are big believers in team autonomy. As a Back-end Developer, you’ll be working with cloud-native technologies and design patterns. You’ll be designing, developing and supporting backend services and microservices that are reliable, scalable, secure and maintainable. The services that you develop will help to deliver a great experience for both our trainers and their students.

We’d like you to be proficient in the following areas: 

Solid commercial experience (5+ years) designing, building and operating scalable, distributed systems as part of a product engineering team
Being responsible for the complete design/develop/test/build/release/maintain web application lifecycle, as well as associated infrastructure and tools - preferably in a Python context
Network design choices covering CDNs, load balancing, VPCs, reverse proxies and DNS
Database and cache design and implementation covering synchronous and asynchronous writes and schema versioning
Data and infrastructure security
Serverless architectures
Peer reviewing code to ensure it meets both functional and non-functional requirements and standards
Building out and supporting CI/CD pipelines that ensure test objectives are automatically delivered and version controlled
A strong understanding and hands on experience of test strategy, scope, efforts, automation and end to end regression testing
Use of development collaboration tools such as Jira, Bitbucket/Git and Confluence
Communicating with technical and non-technical peers

What we can offer you: 

A fun, easy-going environment
Project days to encourage lifelong learning
A high degree of autonomy and the ability to influence team and technology choices
Opportunity to grow with the company
Share options

Working hours and location: 
This is a full-time (40hr), permanent, remote position, but the hours will be up to you. As long as you have a 5-6hr overlap with the core team each day, you can choose when you are online. Please note that due to this requirement, we prefer candidates living ±3hrs from the EST time zone. You must reside in and have the legal right to work within Canada.
