About Ryerson
 At the intersection of mind and action, Ryerson is on a transformative path to become Canada’s leading comprehensive innovation university. Integral to this path is the placement of equity, diversity and inclusion as fundamental to our institutional culture. Our current academic plan outlines each as core values and we work to embed them in all that we do.
 Ryerson University welcomes those who have demonstrated a commitment to upholding the values of equity, diversity, and inclusion and will assist us to expand our capacity for diversity in the broadest sense. In addition, to correct the conditions of disadvantage in employment in Canada, we encourage applications from members of groups that have been historically disadvantaged and marginalized, including First Nations, Metis and Inuit peoples, Indigenous peoples of North America, racialized persons, persons with disabilities, and those who identify as women and/or 2SLGBTQ+. Please note that all qualified candidates are encouraged to apply; however, applications from Canadians and permanent residents will be given priority.
 In August 2021, the university announced that it would begin a renaming process to address the legacy of Egerton Ryerson for a more inclusive future. Let's write the next chapter together.

 Future Skills Centre – Centre des Compétences futures (FSC-CCF)
 The Future Skills Centre – Centre des Compétences futures (FSC-CCF) will test and rigorously measure innovative approaches to identify emerging in-demand skills and to help Canadians develop the skills they need to take full advantage of and succeed in the new economy. Funded by the federal government, the Future Skills Centre is a forward-thinking research centre with a focus on how best to prepare Canadians today for workforce opportunities of the future.
 The FSC-CCF is led by a partnership between Ryerson University, The Conference Board of Canada and Blueprint. The consortium offers deep knowledge of economic and technology trends, public policy, rigorous applied research and evaluation expertise, extensive knowledge mobilization and convening experience, and longstanding commitments to skills training and development.
 The FSC-CCF will forge a network of partners from across the country, linking thousands of service providers, employers, governments, community groups, academic and practitioner researchers, and millions of Canadians to enhance access to in-demand skills and training.
